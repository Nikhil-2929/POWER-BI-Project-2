Uber Request Data Analysis: Understanding the Demand-Supply Gap (Using POWER BI)

This project analyzes Uber’s 2016 request data to identify the demand-supply gap at airport and city pickup points. By examining request patterns, trip completions, cancellations, and driver availability, key insights are derived to improve Uber’s service efficiency.

The data was cleaned using Power BI, handling missing values and duplicates. Visualizations highlight:

Total trips completed (Airport: 1,327 | City: 1,504)

Trips with no available cars (Airport: 1,713 | City: 937)

Cancelled trips (Airport: 198 | City: 1,066)

Total drivers in 2016: 301

Key findings suggest higher unavailability of cars at airports and more customer cancellations in cities. The project provides recommendations such as improving driver allocation and analyzing demand in different city areas. The interactive Power BI dashboard offers a data-driven approach for Uber to optimize its operations.
